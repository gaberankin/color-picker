		<h1>Here's another bloody color picker</h1>
		<p>It's not done yet.  I'm just experimenting with the canvas at this point.</p>
		<div id="col-test"></div>
		<div id="debug"></div>
		<script type="text/javascript">
		var c = new Col(document.getElementById('col-test'));
		c.debug(document.getElementById('debug'));
		</script>

		<h3>Notes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Generation of the picker isn't quick.  this is because we're drawing the circle pixel-by-pixel.  However, I've gotten it as fast as possible by manually manipulating the values in the image data and then plopping the whole thing into the canvas context once rather than once per pixel (don't do that - it makes browsers sad).</li>
			<li>Thanks to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10878209/midpoint-circle-algorithm-for-filled-circles">this stackoverflow item</a> for the inspiration on how to fix my pixel drawing redundancy issues by introducing me to the midpoint circle algorithm</li>
			<li>Firefox isn't picking up mouse events.</li>
			<li>Haven't tested on IE yet.  I am scared to.</li>
